# Distribution & Relationship Master Playbook

> **Mission:** Engineer predictable distribution by building and nurturing a 200‑person advocacy engine ("Inner Circle") that delivers early engagement velocity (100–200 interactions in first 5 minutes) and compounds follower + download growth.

---

## 0. Core Philosophy

- **Distribution > Product (99% vs 1%).** Great product without distribution = invisible. Barely-good product with elite distribution = momentum.
- **Depth > Spray.** Seven meaningful touchpoints in 3–7 days → Loyalty Loop → Inner Circle.
- **Relationship Capital = Launch Fuel.** Viral bursts are manufactured through pre-loaded micro-engagement, not luck.
- **Focus is a Force Multiplier.** One account (Eder) first. Snack / SnackIt accounts are satellites, not primary battlegrounds (until 150–200 core allies exist).
- **Identity:** Become *the architect of 200 superfans*. Everything else = noise until achieved.

## 1. Relationship Ladder (10 Steps)

| Step | DM Metaphor            | Real Meaning                                                          | Success Signal                                         |
| ---- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Post                   | Ship daily anchor tweet (thread, POV, build log).                     | Anchor post published on schedule.                     |
| 2    | Treat like WIFE        | Assume long-term potential with *every* engager; respect + curiosity. | Tone: warm + specific (not generic praise).            |
| 3    | Go on dates            | Light public back-and-forth replies.                                  | They reply at least once.                              |
| 4    | Get to know them       | Profile recon: pinned + last 5 posts + bio. Extract 1 personal hook.  | Added to CRM w/ personal fact.                         |
| 5    | Make them smile        | Tailored witty/value reply that shows you *saw* them.                 | Quick like / response.                                 |
| 6    | More dates             | 2–3 more quality touches within 48h.                                  | Reciprocal pattern emerges.                            |
| 7    | Get intimate (DM)      | DM referencing public context → micro question or resource.           | DM thread ≥5 messages OR they share non-public detail. |
| 8    | Engage w/ everything   | Systematic coverage of their content inside your 2h blocks.           | 100% of new posts touched <1h.                         |
| 9    | Inner Circle           | Mutual auto-engagement reflex triggers w/o prompting.                 | They tag / mention you proactively.                    |
| 10   | Take to bed (Advocacy) | Ask for public amplification (shoutout, update mention, inclusion).   | They amplify on request.                               |

**Escalation Triggers:**

- Two replies same day → Move to Stage 4.
- Likes + follow + replies across 2 posts → Stage 6.
- DM with depth (>1 paragraph or resource) → Stage 7.
- Organic tag / mention → Stage 9.
- Public endorsement / newsletter inclusion → Stage 10 (advocate).

**If silence after Stage 6 DM:** Pause 14 days or downgrade Tier.

## 2. CRM System

**Minimum Viable Fields:**

```
Handle | Name | Tier (A/B/C) | Stage (1-10) | Personal Fact | Last Touch (DateTime) |
Touch Count (7d) | Next Action (Date + Type) | Notes | Advocate? (Y/N)
```

**Tier Definitions:**

- **A (Core 50):** High influence + high relevance + reciprocation likelihood. Target daily coverage.
- **B (Growth 100):** Emerging; nurture 3–4x/week.
- **C (Explore Pool):** New leads under evaluation (promote or prune within 2 weeks).

**Rules:**

- New engager logged within **12h** or considered lost.
- Max active deep targets: **200** at any time (hard ceiling). Prune to protect focus.

## 3. 7 Touchpoint Formula (Within 3–7 Days)

| # | Type                         | Example Patterns                                     | Guardrail                        |
| - | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1 | Public value/humor reply     | Highlight a specific line + add micro insight.       | No generic praise.               |
| 2 | Like + soft quote / bookmark | "This line on X → applying to Y."                    | Must add angle; no summary-only. |
| 3 | Second reply (question)      | "Curious what you tried before switching to \_\_\_?" | Genuine curiosity.               |
| 4 | DM opener                    | Reference public post + resource offer.              | Give before ask.                 |
| 5 | Tag in relevant convo        | "@X just explored this yesterday."                   | Authentic relevance only.        |
| 6 | Share / feature them         | Include in mini thread or newsletter snippet.        | Provide clear credit.            |
| 7 | Micro-ask or spotlight       | Invite to space / ask quote permission.              | Only after prior value.          |

**If no response after Touchpoint 3:** Park for 5–7 days before reattempt.

## 4. Daily Operating Rhythm

| Block                | Duration | Objective                | Checklist                                        |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Pre-Post Warmup      | 15m      | Wake graph; prime A-tier | 10 smart replies to A-tier before anchor post    |

| Debrief / CRM Update | 10m      | Close loop               | Update touch counts + next actions + daily score |

**Nightly Hard Stop:** No new leads after debrief (avoid unlogged backlog).

## 5. Engagement Mechanics & Templates

### Reply Framework

`Hook word + micro insight + tailored tie-in + forward nudge`

> "Invisible reps. Your launch thread screams 6 months of quiet iteration—curious what you *cut* last minute?"

### Quote Tweet Framework

`Pattern break / Number / Emotional label + core takeaway + credit`

> "147 downloads in 3 hours. Distribution isn’t luck—@X engineered early velocity."

### DM Opener Types

1. **Echo:** Mirror their phrase + add nuance.
2. **Resource Drop:** "You mentioned X—here’s our template." (No ask.)
3. **Micro-Ask (after value):** Permission to feature a line.
4. **Connector:** Intro to another relevant builder.

### Value Reply Snippets

- "Underrated line: ‘\_\_’. Most optimize for X; you inverted to Y. Stealing that mental model."
- "This reframes metrics as *inputs* not outcomes—gold."

### Humor Reply Snippets

- "Adding ‘emotionally available metrics’ to my KPI dashboard."
- "Brb filing a support ticket with the Algorithm Overlords."

### Advocacy Ask (Earned Only)

> "Putting together tomorrow’s distro breakdown—ok if I include your ‘X over Y’ line? Can link to anything you want boosted."

---

## 6. Launch / “Make This Post Go” Protocol

**Pre-Post (T‑10m):** Warm 10 A + 5 B with high-quality replies. **Pre-Post (T‑5m):** DM 5 Inner Circle: "Dropping a distribution thesis in 5—curious for your take on point 3." **At Post (T=0):** Pin + seed one pre-arranged friendly comment. **0–5m:** Laser-fast personalized replies (no emoji-only). **6–30m:** Two differentiated quote tweets (personal account = emotional angle; brand account = data/process angle). **30–120m:** Continue coverage; log all new high-signal engagers. **2h+:** DM A-tier who missed: "Your POV on the ‘\_’ line would be sharp—curious if you’ve tried similar?" **Never:** Beg "please RT"—anchor on relevance & respect.

## 7. Metrics (Track Daily & Weekly)

| Metric                               | Target               | Purpose                  |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| A-tier Coverage %                    | 90%+                 | Depth consistency        |
| New Qualified Leads                  | 5–10 / day           | Pipeline freshness       |
| Avg Touchpoints per A (7d)           | 6–8                  | Relationship maintenance |
| 5-Minute Engagement Count            | Climb toward 100–200 | Early velocity predictor |
| Follower Growth (Primary)            | 200–300 / week       | Lagging validation       |
| Advocacy Events (shoutouts/mentions) | 5+ / week            | Stage 10 conversion      |

### Daily Micro Score (10-point system)

```
+2 A-tier coverage 90%+
+2 ≥7 meaningful public replies (not fluff)
+2 ≥5 value DMs sent
+2 ≥5 new leads logged
+2 5-min engagement threshold hit (baseline evolving)
```

**If Score <7:** Identify failing bucket; pre-allocate extra time block next day.

---

## 8. Quality Control Rules

1. No generic praise; must include specific reference or question.
2. Value before ask (minimum 3 value deposits pre-advocacy ask).
3. First DM includes unique personal context = proof of attention.
4. Each reply <60s drafting time (opt for frequency of authentic touches).
5. Stay on primary account during core blocks (avoid task switching).
6. No mass-liking without at least one contextual reply = zero relationship credit.
7. Every new engager either logged or ignored deliberately—no limbo.

---

## 9. Escalation Matrix (Condensed)

| Current Stage | Desired Next | Triggered By                   | Action                    |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| 2–3           | 4            | Two-way public reply thread    | Add personal fact to CRM  |
| 4–5           | 6            | 3+ engagements across 48h      | Prep tailored DM resource |
| 6             | 7            | They respond deeply to DM      | Offer micro-collab idea   |
| 7–8           | 9            | Organic tag/mention            | Prep advocacy ask window  |
| 9             | 10           | First successful amplification | Formalize as advocate (Y) |

## 11. Distraction Filter

> **Ask:** "Does this task deepen or create a relationship with someone who can amplify us?"

## 13. Script & Snippet Bank

**Value Reply:**

> "Underrated bit: ‘**’. Most optimize for X; you inverted to Y. Logging that mental model."**\
> **Challenge Reply (Respectful):**** "Curious—if Y is true, how do you reconcile with Z case? Haven’t cracked that tension yet."**\
> **Humor:**** "Shipping ugly V1s so future me can pretend there was a ‘design philosophy’."**\
> **DM Resource Drop:**** "Saw your note on onboarding friction—here’s our 5-line checklist that cut time in half. Use any pieces you want."**\
> **Connector DM:**** "You + @** riff on similar distro loops—worth a quick intro?"\
> **Advocacy Ask:** "Your ‘X over Y’ quote nails tomorrow’s theme. Cool if I feature it? Will link to your latest thread."\
> **Follow-Up Nudge (Soft):** "Circling back—did that template help or totally mid? Can refine if you tried it."

---

## 14. What NOT To Do

- Mass-like without context: zero relationship credit.
- Ask for amplification before 3 value deposits.
- Hoard leads in notifications (unlogged = forgotten = wasted).
- Split focus across multiple primary personas pre-200 Inner Circle.
- Over-engineer replies (perfection tax kills volume).
- Send vague DMs (prove you actually read their stuff).

---

## 15. Identity & Mantra

> **"I manufacture distribution by compounding micro-trust at scale."**\
> **"One #1 > One Hundred #2’s."**\
> **"200 Allies. 5-Minute Velocity. Relentless Depth."**

---

## 16. Pocket Card (Ultra-Pared Down)

**Core Rule:** Distribution > everything. Build 200 humans who auto-engage inside 5 minutes—depth beats volume.\
**Daily Flow:** Warm 10 A → Post anchor → 5-min rapid replies → Log every new engager → Advance 2 stages → 5 value DMs → Cover 90% A-tier posts → Add 5 new leads → Nightly CRM + Score.

---

| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Days 1–30  | System install + hit consistency          | Daily Micro Score ≥7 avg; CRM stable 150 leads |

**CTA Buttons:** `Get the Checklist` | `Download the CRM Template`\
**Sections:** Philosophy • Ladder • Daily Rhythm • Metrics • Scripts • Weekly Review • Pocket Card.

---

## 19. Conversion to Static Site (Vibe Coding Notes)

- **Framework:** MDX + Next.js (drop this file in /content/playbook.mdx).
- **Components to Add Later:** `<ScoreCard />`, `<DailyChecklist />`, `<MetricTrend />`.
- **Color Accent:** Use brand highlight color for Ladder Steps badges.
- **Mobile:** Collapse ladder & metrics into accordion.

---

## 20. Execution Guardrails

- Protect the engagement blocks as *meetings with future virality* (no context switching).
- Review scoreboard BEFORE opening anything else each morning.
- Weekly: ruthlessly prune inactive C-tier clutter.

---

**Final Reminder:** If today you didn’t *create or deepen* at least 10 genuine micro-relationships, you didn’t work on distribution—you did busywork.

> **Go manufacture the 200.**
